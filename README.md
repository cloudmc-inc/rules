**D1. Creation.** A nation must have at least one member, a recognized claim on some territory in order to participate in international relations or receive staff protection. To create a nation, write down its name, population, and its territory in #claims. 

**D2. Leader.** The person who creates a nation is considered that nation’s leader, unless they grant leadership to another player. If the leader leaves the faction or gets permanently banned without granting leadership to anyone, it is up to the members to choose the new leader. Use #claims to declare a new leader.

**D3. Joining/leaving.** 
- **I.)** You may only join a nation and be kicked out of it with permission of the nation’s leader. No person shall be a member of multiple nations. You may leave your nation at any time.

- **III)** Members that want to leave are allowed to take whatever items they like as long as they are still in the nation. It’s up to the leader to declare them kicked out in #claims. 

**D4. Changes in name and leadership.** If a nation changes its name, changes its leader or it is couped, it is still considered the same nation. Same applies for nations that are disbanded and reestablished soon after. Such nations keep all their members and land. Their immunity and cooldown periods do not get reset.

**D5. Uniting.** 
- **I.)** If two nations unite, the newly formed nation is not considered a new nation and keeps all members and all territory of both nations. When uniting, immunity and cooldown of such a nation is not reset, but rather follows the immunity/cooldown of the nation that had fewer days of immunity/cooldown left.
- **II.)** When a nation joins another nation, the latter automatically gets all members of the former, however will not inherit the former’s land. All immunity/cooldown times follow the times of the latter nation.

**D6. Declaring independence.** Only a member of a nation may declare independence from it. Declarations of independence must be posted in #claims. A nation that declares independence is considered a new nation. It may claim all territory that is de facto controlled by its members. Control includes leading a nation, leading a region, being the mayor of a town, or owning a building on your nation’s territory. Such a nation automatically gains all players that reside on its territory.

**D7. Vassals.**
- **I.)**  A vassal is a separate nation from its overlord, and can be created either by choice or as a result of a peace treaty. 
- **II.)**  An overlord can forcefully call in a vassal into a war if they choose to do so. They also have the ability to deny any foreign affairs of their vassal, such as claims, war declarations, players, etc.
- **III.)**  An overlord cannot create claims for a vassal, nor can they declare war for them. They have to do this themselves.
- **IV.)** Vassals must be reasonable and may not be used to abuse or circumvent the rules.
- **V.)** Vassals can declare independence from their overlord at any given time. However, the overlord can respond by declaring war on them.
- **VI.)** When a vassal declares independence it does not get war immunity.


## Section E - Land Claiming Rules

**E1. Claiming.** Territory can be claimed, bought, sold, or given away only with the permission of a nation’s leader. Whenever new territory is gained, you must mention it in #claims with the written consent of both parties.

****E2. Unclaimable land.** The Nether and the End are free for everyone and cannot be claimed; Nether portals and immediate proximity to them are an exception to this. Sea is not protected with the exception of gulfs, lakes, internal waters and - sea near the shore of your nation (see rule E7)** Man-made islands are claimable under the condition that they are visible on the bluemap.

**E3. Overexpansion.** 
- **I.)** The claiming limit for a nation depends on its population and development.
- **II.)** Attempts to circumvent applicable claiming rules by claiming long, thin - strips of land (noodle claims) may be subject to denial by map makers/staff.

**E4. Colonies.** 
- **I.)** A nation can make colonies only when it has 2 or more active members. 
- **II.)** Colonies must be reasonable (e.g. a landlocked country cannot make colonies) and must have at least 1 extra member per colony claimed. For example, a nation with 3 members can have max 2 colonies. 
- **III.)** What counts as a colony is decided by the mapmakers/staff case-by-case. 

**E5. Maritime borders.** 
- **I.)** Every nation that borders the sea gets a maritime border of 16 blocks. 
- **II.)** When two maritime borders overlap, the water belongs to the nation that claimed first.

**E6. Disbanded due to inactivity.** If a nation has been inactive for two weeks or longer without getting a time extension it will be automatically disbanded by the staff team.

**E7. Disputed claims.** 
- **I.)** If two nations claim the same territory it will be marked as “disputed territory” with striped lines including the colors of both nations, the nation that first claimed the land is the actual owner of the land and the person disputing the claim can not grief, loot or build on said land without permission. This disputed territory counts towards both of the nations claim size limit.
- **II.)** If a nation disbands and another nation is disputing a part of its claims, they automatically acquire the disputed land after that nation disbands.
- **III.)** If a nation claims land of another nation and the nation that the claim is on gets annexed by someone else, the claim carries over to the new overlord of said land.


## Section F - Gameplay Rules

**F1. Griefing.** 
- **I.)** When not at war, you may grief or edit claimed buildings and structures - (including signs) only if you are the leader of the nation or have explicit permission from the leader. 
- **II.)** Everyone can edit naturally generated terrain that is unclaimed or claimed by the nation they are in; however, irreversibly damaging natural terrain (i.e. lava casting, excessive TNT bombing, etc.) is prohibited even if the land is unclaimed. The exception to this is the nether and the end (except the main island). 
- **III.)** Griefing by generating portals into claimed land when there is no clear reason for it is not allowed. 
- **IV.)** During war, griefing is allowed as long as it’s directly relevant to the fight and not unnecessary, in claimed land. In unclaimed land, all griefing is allowed during war, as long as it’s directly or indirectly relevant to the fight. 

**F2. Killing.** You may attack and kill another person even when not at war. Repeated killing over a long period of time with no real benefit or reason is not allowed. Spawnkilling is not allowed either. 

**F3. Stealing/looting.** Stealing from claimed territory is not allowed except in griefing wars. 


## Section G - War Rules

**G1. Declaration of war.** 
- **I.)** To declare war, you need to post a message in #war, which includes the following:
  - A sentence that says who you are declaring war against. 
  - A list of members from your nation that will be soldiers. At least one person is required to be a soldier. 
  - A suggestion to where and when the first battle may take place.
  - Pinging the enemy leader(s). 

  *A war declaration is not valid unless these terms are fulfilled.*
- **II.)** In order to declare war you need at least 2 medium sized houses to count as settlements, this is checked by moderators before the war is confirmed.
- **III.)** The nation that gets declared on has 24 hours to confirm the war declaration, and present a list of soldiers. They have another 24 hours to either agree on the time and place suggested by the attacker, or present their own. The administrators is responsible for deciding a time and place if there is no agreement. 
- **IV.)** Both sides need to agree at the point of war declaration if crystal pvp should be allowed or not in the war. Using end crystals and respawn anchors as a means to kill or damage people or ground during the battle all counts as crystal pvp. 

**G2. War immunity.** 
- **I.)** If a nation was created by a player that has recently joined a world, such a nation may not be declared war on for 7 days. Nations founded afterwards are immune to war declarations for 5 days since the establishment of that nation.
- **II.)** If a nation with immunity declares war on another nation, it loses its immunity.
- **III.)** If a nation that has declared independence from another nation is declared war on by that nation, it loses its immunity.
- **IV.)** A nation may declare war on another nation with immunity with the latter nation’s permission.

**G3. War cooldown.** 
- **I.)** A nation cannot declare war or be declared upon if fewer than 24 hours have passed since it signed a peace treaty (one exception to this rule is G2 article IV).
- **II.)** Two nations that have been recently at war with each other cannot declare war on each other if fewer than 48 hours have passed since they signed a peace treaty, even if both leaders give permission.

**G4. Volunteers/Mercenaries.** 
- **I.)** During war, anyone can join the army of another nation, but only with permission from the leader of the warring nation. The leader of the warring nation may revoke this permission at any time. Each volunteer must mention which army they are joining in #war.
- **II.)** You may not volunteer if you are not a member of any nation. You may not volunteer for two nations at the same time. During a war cooldown between yours and another nation, you may not volunteer against the latter.
- **III.)** One nation may only send a max of 2 volunteers to one side in a war.
- **IV.)** Griefing a volunteer’s mother nation during a griefing war is not allowed.

**G5. Teleports.** You are not allowed to use /home commands during war. Using this may result in a forced defeat. 

**G6. Supervision.** Wars are supervised by moderators, and they enforce capitulations and peace treaties.

**G7. Activity.** Every nation or coalition at war needs to have at least 45 minutes of combined activity per day during the war. This can either be one member alone, or several combined (although if 2 or more are on at the same time it will not be stacked, 30 members being on for the same minute at once will still be - counted as 1 minute of wartime activity). Civilians, volunteers and moderators conducting activity checks do not contribute to combined activity.

**G8. Coalitions.** Nations may decide to form a coalition during the war. All nations in a coalition participate in the war. This is different from volunteering as you are not limited to 2 people per nation, and your wartime activity counts.

**G9. Griefing wars.** If one or both sides are inactive at the time of a battle, the war will automatically become a griefing war, where the win condition for the war would be to grief all settlements enough to become unusable. A griefing war can also be directly declared. Griefing will only be legal when a soldier of the target nation is online.

**G10. Peace treaties.**
- **I.)** Volunteers can be mentioned and individually held accountable in peace treaties.
- **II.)** A war may end only with a peace treaty. All peace treaties must be posted in #peace-treaties and must be signed by leaders of all nations that were at war.
- **III.)** Nations may sign a voluntary peace treaty to end the war. Voluntary peace treaties are not enforced by staff.
**IV.)** Automatic capitulation occurs when one side has a clear advantage in the battle and has practically wiped all resistance from the area, reported to the staff, and verified by the staff team. When automatic capitulation occurs the winning nation may write a peace treaty, terms decided by them (within the limit of - rules) and it is automatically accepted by the enemy nation, whether voluntarily or not.
- **V.)** Peace treaties involving anything other than taking land, disbanding, abandoning land, kicking out players and vassalization, are not enforceable by staff, and therefore have to be enforced by the players themselves. If a nation however breaks the non-enforceable part of a peace treaty then the war cooldown between those two nations is canceled, and war can occur immediately. Note that this will be decided by the staff team and the non-enforceable part being reasonable will be taken into account.
- **VI.)** If a nation is disbanded during a war, it capitulates. An involuntary treaty is signed, in which the losing nation must accept all reasonable offered peace terms. 
- **VII.)** If a member or multiple members of a nation during war break an important rule which considerably changes the outcome of a war, that nation will be forced to surrender.
- **VIII.)** Annexing land as part of a peace treaty is enforceable by staff. There is no limit to how much land you can annex, and you can keep it for 2 weeks before it counts as land in terms of activity.
